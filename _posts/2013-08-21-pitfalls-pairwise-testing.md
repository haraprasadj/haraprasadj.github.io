title: Pitfalls Of Pairwise Testing
categories: [TechNotes]
---

I am a fan of great testers like James Bach, and like every other tester used his Allpairs
tool on a few occasions never bothering to question the validity of its premise.

Recently I read a paper by James Bach himself which outlines the pitfalls that need to be understood
before applying and realized how important his statement in the paper is when he says  
'Develop skill, take ownership, but do not trust "Best Practice"'.

The paper can be downloaded [here](http://www.testingeducation.org/wtst5/PairwisePNSQC2004.pdf)

This is a must read for all testers. This reminds us that testing is as much theoretical and
analytical as it is practical. Understating the science behind every technique we use is of utmost
importance.

Like in every other walk of life blind faith is dangerous.
