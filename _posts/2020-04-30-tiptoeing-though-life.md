The distance,  
it seems longer  
and the journey,  
it seems harder

Walking through life,  
tiptoeing, escaping,  
shards of broken heart  
and shattered dreams

Evading the pieces  
scattered on the floor,  
the feet are safe  
but the heart hurts more

Memories, bitter and sour  
cause more pain  
than a piece of glass  
piercing the feet ever can

All one can hope  
is to learn to cope  
and keep marching on,  
keep trudging along
