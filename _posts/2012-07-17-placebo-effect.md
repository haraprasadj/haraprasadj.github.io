title: Placebo Effect - Proof Of Alternative Medicine ?
categories: [Essay]
---

A [placebo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo) is a simulated or otherwise medically
ineffectual treatment for a disease or other medical condition intended to deceive the
recipient. Sometimes patients given a placebo treatment will have a perceived or actual
improvement in a medical condition, a phenomenon commonly called the placebo effect.

In simpler terms, to test the effectiveness of a drug, some participants in a clinical research
are given something other than the medicine being tested and some of the people taking this
neutral compound are cured.

It begs to reason, how in the name of science, can someone be cured just by imagining that
they are taking the medicine. Unfortunately, this does not seem to concern anyone and this is
accepted as normal phenomenon. I think that further studies on placebo effect can help identify
the mechanism that triggers the healing process without the use of any medicines.

But obviously this would be counterproductive to the medical industry. Because if I
could cure myself without any external agents or professional help ... the consequences would
be too drastic for the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry.

But let us think logically for a moment what could cause this effect. One cause could be that
the patient's belief that he is about to be cured might actually cause this healing. Mind
seems to have the power of healing when supported by absolute belief. This could be the reason
why only a few experience placebo effect because belief and positivity are rare virtues. In
fact, studying this might lend proof to the alternative treatments that rely on concentrated
positive thinking.
