Failure is more likely to give us company than success. Success is like spring, the best time of the year, but with us only for 3 months. We have to live through another winter, fall and summer to meet it again.  
 
If we define success in a competitive manner, as in winning the Olympic gold, it is all too obvious. Each successful person is cheered on by numerous unsuccessful ones.  
If we define success as achieving a personal goal, well, each of us has enough experience dealing with unreachable goals and unfulfilled dreams.  

The only definition that always beats the odds is of achieving happiness. And the reason is that happiness is a choice.  

Now that we have established that we are more likely to fail than succeed, learning to to handle failure becomes extremely important in achieving success eventually. As someone aptly said, falling is not a problem; but not getting up after the fall is.
And therein lies the importance of learning "The Art of Failing".

There are three steps to handling failure: revel, retrospect, resume.  

Revel in the progress made, thanking the universe for bringing us to where we are  
Retrospect in the reasons of failing, identify how to do better  
Resume on the path once again, for, persistence leads to success eventually.
