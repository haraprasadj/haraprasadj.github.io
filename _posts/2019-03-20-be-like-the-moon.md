“Be like the moon, my son, be like the moon”, said the guru,  
glancing kindly at the disciple.

The disciple was perplexed.  
Is the guru asking me to be like the moon that waxes and wanes?  
The moon that causes the disturbances in the ocean’s waters and people’s minds?  
The moon that has no light of its own but shines by borrowed brightness?

Should he not rather be like the sun that shines bright and steady on all days?  
The sun that gives life to all the earthlings?

Understanding his confusion, the guru goes on to explain.

“Be like the moon that owns no light, and holds no light  
It reflects back the light all through the night  
When the sun is not there to make the skies bright

Be like the moon that waxes and wanes  
Teaching us that all life begins and ends  
But the glory it loses, it also regains

Be like the moon that receives heat and light  
But reflects only cool moonlight  
While burning itself with all the heat

The moon teaches us that life is borrowed  
We cannot own anything but we can be kind  
And share what we have with those in need

All the pain that life causes to you  
Is only yours to suffer and endure  
You should only spread joy and cheer

Every beginning has an end  
Every end is a new beginning  
Despair not when all is lost  
For there is more now to regain”
