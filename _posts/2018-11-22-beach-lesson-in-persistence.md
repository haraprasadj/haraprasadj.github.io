The beach - the ground zero of an eternal war, the war between land and sea.

The land looks on from behind its barricade of mighty rocks at the ocean’s struggle with arrogance, not realising that with each wave the ocean is wearing down that barricade bit by bit.

The rocks guarding the land break every wave with ease. Yet, the ocean relentlessly hits back with more waves.

The strength of the rocks holding back the ocean seems unbeatable. Yet, the ocean does not give up.

The land seems to win each of the battles. I feel, however, that in the end the ocean will win. Not by strength, but by persistence.
