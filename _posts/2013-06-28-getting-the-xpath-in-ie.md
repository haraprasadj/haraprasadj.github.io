title: Getting XPATH Of An Element In Internet Explorer
categories: [Software Testing]
---

Knowing the xpath of a web element is very important when using Selenium automation.
Firefox luckily has many tools to get the xpath. However, when automating applications that run only on IE
there is no way to get the xpath.

I found the following article that describes how to identify the xpath even in IE 
[here](http://functionaltestautomation.blogspot.in/2008/12/xpath-in-internet-explorer.html)

Wonderful solution !!!
