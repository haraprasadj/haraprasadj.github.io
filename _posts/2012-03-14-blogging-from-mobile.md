Testing blogger application for Android. It is not bad at all. It is really amazing to consider 
the pace at which technology entered our lives in the last decade.  

In fact it is not a decade yet since I first held a mobile phone in my hand, a large device 
that looked like a cordless phone with large keys. And all we could do with it was make a phone 
call.  

Today a mobile phone is also used for making a phone call apart from the important functions of 
staying online and in touch.It is no longer seems far-fetched to imagine that we are moving 
towards a future where our brains would be connected to devices directly and we would be
doing everything by merely thinking. Let's wait and see.
