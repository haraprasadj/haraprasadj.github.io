She glides past me,  
like an angelâ€™s feather  
I feel a cool breeze,  
in scorching weather  
The touch of her tresses  
made wind break tether  
Am I in love?

A glance from her,  
and I feel my whole being flutter  
I try to talk to her,  
but tongue starts to stutter  
She cannot hear,  
but her name, my voice does mutter  
Am I in love?

My feelings for her, one day, I try to explain  
She looks at me, listens to me, but in disdain  
I had never felt, in my heart, such severe pain  
I am in love!
