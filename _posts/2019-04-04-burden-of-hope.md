I spent all my days  
striving for a distant dream  
driven by ambition, fuelled by hope

All I have left now  
are memories of each futile attempt  
and pieces of broken dreams that pierced my heart

I wish I was careless  
living each day for what it was meant to be

I wish I was hopeless  
not caring what the next day could possibly be

I wish I was free of the burden of hope  
that weighed me down and finally broke me
