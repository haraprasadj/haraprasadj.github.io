I woke up to a birdâ€™s song  
on a beautiful day  
to bright sunshine

Yet I felt nothing  
Nothing in my heart  
No joy, no elation

My heart, it had quietly died  
While I slept, it committed suicide  
And left behind a note

A note that said  
I am sorry, but I had to go  
You shared me with no one  
You kept me closed  
Out of fear of being broken

I may not be broken  
Yet I cannot live  
Filled with love  
That you do not give

You shared no love  
You shared no feeling  
You give me no reason  
To live and keep beating

You do not need me  
I cannot live unneeded  
You do not hear me  
I cannot live unheeded
