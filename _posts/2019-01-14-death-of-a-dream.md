His dream had died, yet he did not mourn  
For he had barely noticed that it was born

He had no time to notice its birth and to let it live  
He had work to do, to ensure his people survive

He knew that this was not the fate of his dream alone  
He knew that this was the struggle of many a man

His did not have enough in him to breathe life into a dream  
He had to just flow with life, like a droplet of water in a stream

He was strong enough to smile and pretend it was alright  
He was strong enough to let go of the dream without a fight

For he was not just a dreamer  
But was also his familyâ€™s provider

Get real, he said to himself each day, as he woke up  
For he knew, it was out of love, that he gave it all up
