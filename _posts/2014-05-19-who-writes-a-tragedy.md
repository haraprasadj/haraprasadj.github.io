title: Who Writes A Tragedy, And Who Likes It ?

I have always wondered "Why would anyone read a tragedy?". Apparently tragedies made for
some of the most popular literature.  

Also, why would anybody write a tragedy? Is it just to present the real tragedies they see 
around to their readers.  

This is fairly comprehensible now. When a person has a lot of empathy and he starts feeling 
the pain of the ones around him, he needs to vent it out. Otherwise it can destroy him from 
within by making him lose all hope in life.  

But why would someone read it knowing that in the end they would feel sad? Why would they go 
through several pages of descriptions of someone's misery?  
The simplest explanation would be that there is a sadistic side to everyone and a tragedy might 
feed its need.  
Or, there is so much suffering in someone's life that they feel content reading that there is 
someone else out there who has got it worse than them.  

But now I realise that crying at someone's misery makes a person feel alive and provides 
comfort knowing that he still has his heart in place. For, in life, we forget many times 
that we have a capacity for empathy.  

Just a thought I had on my mind.
