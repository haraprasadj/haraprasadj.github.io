title: Eclipse Juno vs Eclipse Helios vs Eclipse !@#$%...

We began our journey to Selenium and as the first step we were supposed to install Eclipse IDE 
(Java version). Googled and found the download page and installed.  

We then found that I had installed Eclipse Juno while my colleague installed Eclipse Helios. 
We were upset as one of us had to now reinstall Eclipse. We were even more upset when we could 
not find out which was the correct version from anyone around. Not even the Selenium trainer knew.  

One more round of googling took me the link below which had the answer. (Essentially they are 
just version numbers; Helios is 3.6 and Juno is 4.2.) We eventually saw the pattern in naming.

Creativity is a great quality in developers but it should be understandable by common folk like us!
