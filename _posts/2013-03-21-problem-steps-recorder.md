title: Problem Steps Recorder (Windows7) - Awesome Tool For Manual Testing
categories: [Software Testing]

Recently came across an amazing tool - Problem Steps Recorder. This comes built in with
Windows 7. This can be seen under All Programs > Accessories > System Tools:

What this tool does is to take a screenshot every time you perform a click after you start
recording. Once you stop recording you are prompted to specify the location and file name to store the
recorded steps. It saves the screenshots as a zip file, which when extracted contains an mht file with the
steps performed described at the end

This would be extremely helpful in Manual Testing to take screenshots of the application for 
the test case flow without any additional effort. All you need to do is just to start
recording before the start of execution of a test case.  

Wonderful, isn't it?
