We dissect, dissect into sects  
We unite, unite into groups  

We want someone to give us a reason to start a fight  
We need someone to stand with us, adding to our might    

We need an enemy whom we can resent and hate  
We need a friend to support us in this hate  

We are bundles of contradictions  
We walk around filled with addictions  
Addiction to love, addiction to hate  
Addiction to support, addiction to fight  

We cannot spend a day in equanimity  
We cannot see the inherent unity  

It is time to grow beyond this pettiness  
It is time to think beyond this silliness   
It is time to look beyond this murkiness  

We are each but a speck in this vast universe  
Of unimaginable glory and magnificence  
It is time to wake up to this awareness
