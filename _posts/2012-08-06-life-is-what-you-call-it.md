title: Life Is What You Call It
categories: [Poem]

Life brings joy and we laugh  
It brings sorrow at which we scoff

Both are true, but for a moment  
Why spend more time, in joy or torment  
Both come uninvited, both go away too  
Let them not leave any marks on you

Laugh too much and your stomach will pain  
Alas! There is no pleasure without the pain  
Suffer not the pain, relish not the joy  
For both are sure to just go away

Be happy without reason  
Smile in every season  
Life is reason enough to live  
It takes the meaning that you give

Call it joy, you will laugh  
Call it sorrow, you will cry  
Call it peace, you will smile  
Call it bliss, you will enjoy
