No longer can I feel  
How I felt about her  
My heart has forgiven her

No longer can I remember  
What I felt for her  
My mind has forgotten her

But I still feel the pain  
The pain in my heart  
The heart broken by her

I know not how to soothe my heart  
I know not how to seal its cracks  
And make it whole again

I know not how to share my heart  
I know not how to give its love  
And make it live again
