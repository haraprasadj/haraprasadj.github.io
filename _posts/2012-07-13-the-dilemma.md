There are times when I think I must hold on  
There are times when I can't and just let go  

There are moments when I think I must fight on  
There are moments when I lose hope and just lie low  

Mind wanders from time to time  
Thoughts change from moment to moment  

I know not what I really want  
I know not who I really am  

Do I want to win or to lose  
To fight or to give up  
I can no longer choose  

Think what I may, I need to live  
Till the final call, I need to strive
