title: Let Us All Dream Of A Great Nation - One World

A country and its culture is a manifestation of the dreams and aspirations of the people
that inhabit its boundaries. So understanding a national culture is essentially understanding 
a national idea.  

Unfortunately a national idea is alive and kicking before a country is born. 
Once the country is formed and stabilized, the idea is lost from the minds of the subsequent 
generations of citizens.  

The one way in which it is preserved is by the education system. Unfortunately this is again 
done through the medium of one of the least-loved subjects called history. To top it off, it is 
done in the most boring way of a repetition of what happened centuries ago, rather than as a 
study of the consequences of the actions of the people that lived then. We are given scores for 
how best we memorize the past, not how best we understand the lessons from the past. We all 
know that history repeats itself. Yet we rarely care about learning the lessons from the past.  

There is definitely a group of people who do learn from the past, the criminals. No wonder we 
read about crimes that are planned better, executed better. We know how the system of bribes 
has been revolutionized using corporate management techniques. Unfortunately, we do not see 
this learning helping in better governance.  

The only takeaway from our history classes is the identification of heroes and villains. And 
these too are personal. The same person is a hero in one person's books while being a villain 
in another's. Sadly though very few really try to emulate his hero or avoid the mistakes of 
his villain. Even these strong ideas whither away in higher education (professional courses) 
leading a person to be lost in his profession.  

We do not have a national dream anymore. We do not want our country to be in a certain way. And 
thus the national dream is lost and thereby a nation. All that is left is hatred against 
someone and blind faith in another someone. The good news though is that after a period of 
disintegration leading to disappointment leading to despair, a spark re-ignites this dream. 
We once again want to feel the national pride, the pride of being citizens of that nation. 
This dream, this spark, when fanned with the air of wisdom and right direction leads to a great 
revolution that once again resets the nation to its full potential.  

But do we really need this cycle? Can we not build a system by which the national idea is never 
lost? Yes, we can. We need to identify what we can be proud about in our nation. Then we need 
to ensure that the things we are proud of are sustained and handed over to the next generation 
not as blind rituals like in religion, but as great ideals and the knowledge of the necessities 
of these ideals. This is where history as a subject can help, to demonstrate how certain ideals 
take our nation to greatness and certain weaknesses take it to failure.  

Essentially we need an education system that builds not just intelligence but intellect. This 
needs to be done by an analytical study rather than axiomatic principles. This needs a new 
generation of teachers who do not just want to teach but to educate. They should themselves
be intellectual and analytical in their approach; not the pseudo-scientific kind who believe 
what other scientists say but who question everything said by everyone.  

Let us all dream again of great nations. Let us all find national pride again. Not the kind of 
patriotism that imbibes hatred against others but the kind that makes us love our nation and 
respect other nations. Let these great nations learn and collaborate and grow till one day the 
whole world becomes one great nation.
