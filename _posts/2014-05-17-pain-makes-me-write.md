title: Pain Makes Me Write

I write  
Write with pain as my quill and tears as my ink  
Write with my broken heart as my muse  
Write with my sighs as my words  

Everyone can read what I write  
But I alone can know the meaning  
Everyone can understand what I write  
But I alone can perceive the feeling  

I had no idea  
No idea that to be a writer  
All I need to do was to suffer  
And let my emotions break their tether
