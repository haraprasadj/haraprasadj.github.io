"The earth has enough for everyone’s NEED, not for everyone’s GREED." - [Gandhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi)  

This statement appears even more true today than ever. The simple reason is that everybody 
today is thinking of ways to accumulate more wealth. The result - rich gets richer, poor gets 
poorer.  

Let us take the case of real estate prices. Think of a world where every nuclear family just 
owns one house. So India would require just 25 million houses (assuming average family size of 
4 members). When the demand for the extra houses falls, the prices also would fall accordingly.  

But people who have access to money or loans try to keep on increasing the number of properties 
held, as a result demand for property increases causing the price also to go up. When the price 
of property goes up, the owners of property get richer, they can afford more property as banks 
would lend based on current property holding, thus widening the gap between haves and have-nots.   

Now think of the current scenario where some extremely rich individuals (industrialists and 
politicians) have uncountable properties. No wonder property is so expensive today.The same 
applies to gold and diamonds. As depicted in the movie [Blood Diamond](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450259/), 
the desire of a few rich people to own these precious stones is causing the lives of many to be 
destroyed.  

Why are we becoming more and more greedy today? I am not saying this by judging others, but 
by analyzing my own thought processes as they have evolved to an ever-greedier disposition. 
While in college, I wanted a bike. Once I had the bike I began wanting a car. Once I had the 
car I began wanting an SUV. Maybe once I have the SUV I will begin wanting a Sports car!  

Where does this end ? The result is that I am never truly happy with what I have. I want a 
better job with bigger salary so that I can afford a better lifestyle. I now feel the main 
reason is that we have no higher goal in life today. We want to enjoy more - so enjoying more 
is our goal. But the moment we include the term "more", we stop enjoying what we have and keep
aspiring for the "more".  

I developed a theory that spirituality was a technique of escaping from reality. I used to 
think it was designed for losers. But now I think that spirituality is a technique of 
establishing our mind on the reality rather than letting it run after "more". So I think that 
today we need to ask ourselves "What do I really need? What is going to keep me happy once and 
for all?" This might be construed by some as the pondering of a loser who has not got what he
wanted.  

Anyway, this was just a thought I had on my mind.
