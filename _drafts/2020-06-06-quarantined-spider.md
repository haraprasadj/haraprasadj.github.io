Jose Fernandez looked out through the dirty window, peering through his frosted spectacles, looking down at the empty street with only a police car buzzing through every few hours. Jose was not in a prison, he was in New York, in fact in the middle of downtown New York.

Just a few weeks ago it seemed like everybody in the country was driving across his building. His attempts at taking short walks always met with angry drivers honking at his feeble gait and slow pace. Now the entire street was empty, yet he could not stroll around.

Those were extraordinary times. The year was 2020 and the entire world was shut down by a virus. Yes, the entire world was quarantined to prevent the spread of a virus.
Not one person in the world could have imagined the scenario. It was unprecedented and unforeseen.

Jose was a retired widower who lived alone in a plush apartment he bought while working as a stock broker just a few streets away. His maid could no longer come as she was quarantined too. As a result the apartment was getting dirtier and he was getting grumpier, cursing everyone he remembered.
